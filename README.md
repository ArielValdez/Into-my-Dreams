# Into-my-Dreams
Dream simulator inspired by Yume Nikki

## Ideas
* The theme of the game is feeling of judgement
* Lucidity levels: there are places that cannot be accessed normally, and they are block by the levels of lucidity
    * Said levels are hidden levels
    * Lucidity levels up by collecting certain number of effects
* Other abilities: These are abilities that are passive to the player, and changes a bit gameplay
* Isometric maps and platformer like maps
* Minigames on a TV at the start of the game (just like Yume Nikki)
* Inner Demon: NPC that randomly spawns in a world the PC is in, and would try to wake up forcibly the PC
* No fighting just walk
